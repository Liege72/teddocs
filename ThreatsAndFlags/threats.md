# Threat Evaluations

Each user has a threat level that is displayed in the color of the flag they have. Threat evaluations are determined by the users activity and how they behave on Discord. For example: should a user spam, TED collects this information and builds an evaluation.

If a user is less trusted by TED, harsher actions will be taken when they behave poorly. TED will be more lenient with trusted users. 

You can see the different threat evaluations below.

- Alpha
- Bravo
- Charlie
- Delta
