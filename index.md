# Setting Up TED

TED will basically be useless if you do not setup a modlog channel. Setup the modlog channel with the command below.

=== Modlog channel
```
/modlog-channel <channel>
```
Enables modlogs for the provided channel; the bot will send all modlogs and alerts to this channel.
===

You'll also want to take a look at the server settings upon inviting TED. Some features are enabled by default, while others are not. Check your servers settings with the command below.

=== View server settings
```
/server-settings
```
Lists all the server settings for the current guild.
===

Okay, you're probably good. Report bugs if you find any.
