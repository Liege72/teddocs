# Privacy Policy

*Effective January 25th, 2023*

When we say “TED,” “T.E.D.,” “the bot,” “our,” "we," "us," in these terms, we mean the Discord Application with the client id: "879360985738117120" and the username "TED#0811."

When we say “services” in these terms, we mean the service(s) that TED provides on the Discord platform.

The terms "guild" and "server" are defined by Discord as: "individual hubs split into two parts: text channels and voice channels." We are referring to this definition when we use these terms. 

### Agreement

By inviting TED to your guild/server, you and all other Discord users within the guild/server at that current time and all other users that may join said guild/server in the future (while TED is on the guild/server) automatically agree to this Privacy Policy.


### Collected Data

The following data are collected by TED:

- **Guild ID:** Guild IDs are gathered to record guild-specific configurations, contribute to user threat evaluations, and organize message data. A servers ID is stored upon TED joining a guild and each time a message is sent in said server.

- **Channel ID:** Text channel IDs are collected for TEDs logging utilities and to organize message data; they are stored each time a message is sent in said channel or when a channel is configured to send moderator or audit logs.

- **User ID:** User IDs are collected to associate compiled threat evaluations with their respective users, document both automated and user-initiated infractions, and maintain message records. They are sometimes stored when a command involving a user is used and each time a user sends a message.

- **Message ID:** Message IDs are acquired to uniquely store each message sent within the database; they are collected each time a message is sent.

- **Message Content:** Message content is collected and stored in temporary memory (otherwise known as "cache") for approximately 30 seconds. Should one of TEDs services suspect a message of containing a scam or phishing URL, the suspected link may be stored permanently to further advance TEDs detection services.

### Data Distribution and Visibility

#### Distribution
None of the data TED has collected thus far and will collect in the future will be distributed to or otherwise viewable to any third parties. 

Only upon a user's explicit request can their specific data be shared.

#### Visibility
All data collected by TED is strictly accessible to TEDs developers. 

Data is not regularly viewed.

Users with specific permissions in a guild have limited access to see data related to their guild and the users within the guild.

### Data Protection

Data collected by TED is securely stored in a remote database.

In the event of a(n) data breach or unintentional information disclosure, an announcement may be made viewable for up to 30 days on this page. 

### Data Removal

Data collected by TED will only be deleted if one of the following events occurs:

- A command that involves deleting data is used
- A service of TEDs automatically deletes data
- TEDs developers drop (delete) a collection or database
- A user requests their data is deleted (join our support server to make this request)

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be announced at least 30 days before taking effect. Notices may only be visible on this page.
