# Log Channels

To start using TED, you will want to setup a modlog channel. TED will log everything it finds to be suspicious. The bot basically needs the modlog channel to function... just set it up.

=== Modlog channel
```
/modlog-channel <channel>
```
Enables modlogs for the provided channel; the bot will send all modlogs and alerts to this channel.
===

=== Audit log channel
```
/log-channel <channel>
```
Enables audit logs for the provided channel; the bot will send all guild and user events to this channel.
