# Spam Detection

TED is able to quickly count the amount of messages a user sends and use that information to detect spam and raids. Not only does TED count these messages, but it will only punish users based on their recent activity. TED will be a little more forgiving with trusted users while users that are considered threats will be punished harsher. 

More trusted users will be issued a warning or two before TED takes more serious actions. Less trusted users may be given no warning at all and action will be taken instantly after spam is detected. 

!!!warning
Sometimes TED will send two warnings or timeout messages when only one should be sent. Please join the
