# Scam/Phish Detection

TED is able to catch and delete most scam/phishing links related to Discord sent in your server.

!!!warning
While false positives are rare, they can still happen. Please [join our support server](https://discord.gg/uuDZzBsNvA) if you encounter a false positive.
!!!

### Detection Confidence
Messages that contain suspicious links are automatically deleted. TED has to be at least 80% confident for the message to be automatically deleted. For messages that TED is less confident in (70-79%), a message will be sent in the guilds modlog channel with the option to delete it.

!!!
If you find a link that you think TED should have recognized, please [join our support server](https://discord.gg/uuDZzBsNvA) to tell us.
