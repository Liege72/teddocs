# Terms of Service

*Effective January 25th, 2023*

When we say “TED,” “T.E.D.,” “the bot,” “our,” "we," "us," in these terms, we mean the Discord Application with the client id: "879360985738117120" and the username "TED#0811."

When we say “services” in these terms, we mean the service(s) that TED provides on the Discord platform.

The terms "guild" and "server" are defined by Discord as: "individual hubs split into two parts: text channels and voice channels." We are referring to this definition when we use these terms. 

### Agreement

By inviting TED to your guild/server, you and all other Discord users within the guild/server at that current time and all other users that may join said guild/server in the future (while TED is on the guild/server) automatically agree to these terms of service.

### Using TED

1. You may not use TED on guilds that violate Discords terms of service or community guidelines.
2. You may not use TED to violate Discords terms of service or community guidelines.
3. TED is intended for use as is provided and is not to be modified in any way.
4. You agree to not intentionally try to break, damage, or otherwise impair the functions and services of TED unless given explicit permission to do so by TEDs developers.
5. You may not use TED to advertise anything in any way.
6. You may not use a bot or other service to automate your interactions with TED.

### Changes to TED

1. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue TEDs services at any time without any given notice.
2. Modifications, updates, and bug fixes are implemented at our own discretion. 

### Liability

1. We are not responsible for damages caused to your guild by other users or services on Discord even if TED was expected to take measures to stop said users and/or services.
2. We are not responsible for damages cause to your guild as a result of a user taking advantage of a bug or otherwise exploiting TEDs services to harm your guild. 
3. You understand that TED is in a beta phase/period and cannot be expected to perform properly or as expected at all times.

### Termination

1. We reserve the right to forbid your guilds access to TEDs serveries at any times for any reason without notice.

### Privacy
